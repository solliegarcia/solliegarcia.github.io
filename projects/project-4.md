# ICS 314 Project

During the Fall 2016 semester at University of Hawaii at Manoa, I took a course called ICS 314 Intro to Software Design. Throughout this course we were taught from basic html to functional programing using Javascript. At then end of the semester, small groups were tasked to create a web app and ours is called GroupsUp.

# What is GroupsUp?

GroupsUp is a web application that allows UH Manoa students to search for university recognized clubs. The way that clubs are displayed is easy for the user to search by interests. Each student is allowed to make a profile, follow clubs, and view clubs.

# What did I do?

Since this was a group collaboration, each person had something they were tasked to do. In the early stages of the assignment I took up the task of organizing the project. Setting up all github collaboration pages, making sure everyone understands how git works and how it is best used. Later, I took on designing some pages layout such as the landing page by using Semantic UI and also with designing the database system for the project.
