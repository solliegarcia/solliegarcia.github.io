The Problem: Every student has questions they want to ask and need an answer **fast** but most don't have the insentive to answer.

The Solution: A community driven web app where students can create a question, and put a 'value' on it via credit system. Additional students can add more credits to the question and who ever provides the answer gets the entire pot.  

Landing page would list top bounty questions of the day and refreshes automatically. An area to ask a question. A place to view your profile.

Students can create questions and students can answer. Each student gets a certain amount of credits a day for logging in and can gain credits by answering other students questions. Profile page has past answered questions, a reputation system. Questions decay after a week in order to keep questions and answers fresh and current. Credits could eventually be redemed for gift cards etc.
