# Learning to Walk
I have learned through my two years at a university is that to be successful in the
technology field, you must be always eager to know more. I decided to take ICS my senior year
of high school with little experience in the field. Of course I enjoyed video games and computers
recreationally, but never once wrote a line of code. My freshman year shoved me head-first into the field,
learning how to write, becoming comfortable with asking for help. It wasn't until my second year I completely
fell in love with ICS.
# Learning to Run
I was luck enough to get a part time job as an assistant full-stack web developer working on an existing project
known as Hawaiian Assessment. Going into this job, I had no experience in the platform they used, Ruby on Rails.
The past developer recommended me to my employer because he saw my eagerness to learn. It was an eye opener to me,
that I was hired solely on that fact that loved learning. The first few months were not easy, I read textbooks, spent
hours reviewing the thousands of lines of code already written. However I got to see the development from the beginning
to the end. It wasn't until this opportunity where I got a taste of real, applicable software development.
# Running the Marathon
I am in this for the long run. I want to learn everything I can about software development that this class has to offer.
I want to be better at what I do; this will take practice, time, sweat and maybe some tears. But in the end it will all be worth it.
What I learn in this class will be carried through my career for the foreseeable future. I believe
the most valuable lesson that can be learned from this class is working as a team.
